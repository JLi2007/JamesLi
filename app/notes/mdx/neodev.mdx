## founding neodev

#### neodev was founded in may 2024 after some fellow buddies and i identified some glaring issues in a typical hackathon experience.
##### 1. they lacked enthusiasm and energy.
##### 2. the small team sizes didn't reflect industry standards.
##### 3. beginners didn't feel sufficiently welcomed.

<h4> we then founded the neo developer league. our small team held weekly meetings in a random concealed room in a <span className="underline">uw science building</span> for months. we planned an event experience like no other and pitched it to the world, gaining support from the <span className="italic">wrdsb, convictional ai,</span> and <span className="italic">den 1880</span> in the heart of uptown waterloo. </h4>
